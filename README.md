omxremote
=========

python web control for omxplayer, or any command line media player that takes keyboard input

Setup:
------
Run omxremote.py, sqlite db is created and initialized automatically
Add paths to monitor for files on settings page
Set appropriate executable and command line arguments ('-o hdmi' for omxplayer using hdmi)
Profit?

Currently, button presses are set up for mplayer (was testing using mplayer). Quit, Pause, and Play are the same for omxplayer though, so those should work fine without any modification.
