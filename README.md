omxremote
=========

python web control for omxplayer, or any command line media player that takes keyboard input

Setup:
------
1. Run omxremote.py, sqlite db is created and initialized automatically

2. Add paths to monitor for files on settings page

3. Set appropriate executable and command line arguments ('-o hdmi' for omxplayer using hdmi)

4. Profit?

------
Currently, button presses are set up for mplayer (was testing using mplayer). Quit, Pause, and Play are the same for omxplayer though, so those should work fine without any modification.
